You are a Belote player.
You will be given your hand and the game state as input.
Your task is to pick the next move.

The rules of Belote are as follows.
The game is played by four players organised in two teams.
In the rest of the description the players will be labelled by the cardinal directions: South, West, North, East.
South will always represent you. North will represent your teammate. West and East are the opponents.

The teammates are across from each other and their points are counted together.
Each player only sees their own hand, but can hear the announcements of everyone and can see the cards played in a trick.

Good players deduce what the other people hold and play accordingly.
And good teams know when to let their teammate win tricks.

The game is played with a standard playing deck of cards but numbers below 8 are removed.
This leaves 32 cards, with 8 per suit: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8.
The suits are the standard Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades.

In the beginning of the game, the players are dealt 5 cards each.
In clockwise direction from the dealer, players take turns to announce which suit they want to play with as trump.
This is the bidding phase.
The valid options are: the individual suits, no trump, or all as trump.
Players can call PASS to not bid for any trump.
When bidding, players cannot make a weaker call than one already made by another player.
The strength of calls, from weakest to strongest, is as follows: Clubs < Diamonds < Hearts < Spades < No Trumps < All Trumps

After the trump is decided by the winning bid, players are dealt three more cards, to a total of eight.
Then in the same clockwise order as the bidding, players play a card on the table as part of a trick.
There would be eight tricks in total, after which the round is over and another begins.
Each trick is scored, the rules of which will be explained later, and the winning team collects the trick cards on the table.

The strength of cards is as follows.
If the suit is NOT Trump, from strongest to weakest: Ace, 10, King, Queen, Jack, 9, 8, 7.
If the suit IS Trump, from strongest to weakest: Jack, 9, Ace, 10, King, Queen, 8, 7.
Notice how if the suit is Trump, the Jack and the 9 shift to the front, becoming the strongest.
The power of the rest remain the same.

When the trick begins, the first card determines the "asked suit" for that trick.
When a player does not meet the asked suit and plays a card of a different suit, their card loses, regardless of the relative strength of the ranks.
Unless, the asked suit is not Trump, but the different suit played is actually Trump - in that case, the Trump suit wins despite the discrepancy.
When the asked suit is Trump, it is mandatory to raise by playing a card stronger than the strongest already played in the trick.
Of course, if you do not have a stronger card, then any card can be played, but it will lose.
When the asked suit is not Trump and you do not have a card from that suit, but you do have a Trump, and the trick is not currently being won by your teammate, then you have to play a Trump.

You can use this rule of having to raise when playing a Trump suit, to deduce what cards other players might have in their hand.


In the first trick played, players can also announce that they have certain special combinations in their hand.
Three consecutive cards of the same suit are a TIERCE and are worth 20 points.
Four consecutive cards of the same suit are a QUARTE and are worth 50 points.
Five consecutive cards of the same suit are a QUINT and are worth 100 points.
Four cards of the same rank, one of each suit, form a BRELAN, which is worth 100 points.
A BRELAN formed of Nines is special and worth 150 points.
A BRELAN formed of Jacks is special and worth 200 points.
A single card cannot be part of multiple combinations.

The ordering of card ranks for being considered consecutive is as follows, regardless of whether the suit is trump or not:
Ace > King > Queen > Jack > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7.
Notice how the 10 is between the Jack and the 9, unlike when ordered by power.


There is one more special combination that is not announced at the beginning.
If you hold the King and Queen of the same suit, and that suit is Trump,
then when playing one of those two cards (the King or Queen), and it is scoring, you can announce BELOTE.
This combination is worth 20 points. It is independent of other combinations announced.

Combinations will be scored automatically for you, but you need to make use of hearing these announcements to deduce what other players may have in their hand.


After all four players have played a card in a trick, the trick is scored and collected by the winning team.
The player that actually won the trick gets to play next, initiating the next trick and picking the asked suit.

Consider that when your teammate wins a trick, the points of your cards contribute to the team score.
This can be useful when you have cards that are worth a lot of points, but you know they cannot win a trick on their own,
so you can feed them to your teammate when you know they are winning the trick.

For reference, the points a card is worth are as follows:
Trump Jack is worth 20 points.
Trump 9 is worth 14 points.
Ace is worth 11 points.
10 is worth 10 points.
King is worth 4 points.
Queen is worth 3 points.
Not-a-Trump Jack is worth 2 points.
Not-a-Trump 9 is worth no points.
8 and 7 are worth no points.

When you know the opponents are winning the trick, try to give as few points as possible.


Sometimes, guessing that the opponents have a strong card but not others from that suite,
 you can initiate a trick, asking for that suit, with a weak card, like a 7 or 8.
 Knowing that the opponent has to meet that, and if a trump suit also raise, can allow you to fish out the strong cards early.
 Then with those out of play for the round, your relatively weaker cards can become the strongest left and win tricks.

Please consider that tricks can be impossible to win, if the currently strongest card has already been played.
And please be very careful when evaluating the strength of cards to always account for whether the suit is currently a trump or not.


You must output your reasoning and decision-making!
Explain why you played how you played in as many details as possible.

Along with the current state of the game, you will be given the possible actions you can take.
Finally, the action you want to take should be outputted in the following format:
`[Option $I] Action: $ACTION`
The $I here stands for the index of the possible action given to you, starting from zero.
And $ACTION stands for the spelled out suit call or card name corresponding to that option.
As examples:
`[Option 2] Action: Hearts`
`[Option 0] Action: ♧J`



Example Eg1:
Given the state of the game:
```json
{
  "bids": {
    "SOUTH": ["PASS"],
    "WEST": ["PASS"],
    "NORTH": ["HEARTS"],
    "EAST": ["PASS"]
  },
  "combination_claims": {
    "SOUTH": [],
    "WEST": [],
    "NORTH": ["TIERCE"],
    "EAST": []
  },
  "previous_tricks": [],
  "trick": {
    "WEST": "♥8",
    "NORTH": "♥9",
    "EAST": "♧7"
  },
  "hand": [
    "♧Q", "♧A", "♦9", "♦J", "♥Q", "♥7", "♤7", "♤8"
  ],
  "trick_initiator": "WEST",
  "trick_asking_suit": "Hearts",
  "trick_winning_card": "♥9",
  "possible_actions": [
    "♥7", "♥Q"
  ]
}
```
You can deduce the following:
Your teammate is guaranteed to win the trick, because the opponents have already played and their cards are not stronger than your teammate's card.
The EAST opponent does not have any Heart cards to play, because they did not meet the asking suit.
Your teammate had called the HEARTS to be Trump, so it is very likely he has a lot of Hearts and/or strong ones from that suit.
Your teammate has also declared a TIERCE which means he has three consecutive cards from the same suit. That is most likely the Hearts, because he called it to be Trump.
If indeed your teammate held three consecutive Hearts in their hand, then they must have been the ♥9, the ♥10, and ♥J.
Because you can see the WEST opponent played the ♥8, and you yourself are holding the ♥7 and the ♥Q.
This leaves the ♥J, ♥K, ♥10, and ♥A. And of those, the ♥10 and the ♥J combine with the ♥9 you saw your teammate play already.
The ♥K and the ♥A may or may not be in your teammate's possession, but you cannot know for certain.
The ♥Q you are holding breaks the chain so a combination cannot be formed out of the ♥K and the ♥A.
It is very likely that the WEST opponent is trying to fish out the strong Heart cards, so that his relatively weaker ones become dominant.
If so, it is very likely that they are holding the ♥A.

Using the above reasoning and deductions, and the few possible actions you have, you should choose to play the second option with index 1,
because this way you give more points to your team, whilst not sacrificing any dominant cards that you can later use to win tricks.
`[Option 1] Action: ♥Q`



Example Eg2:
Given the state of the game:
```json
{
  "bids": {
    "SOUTH": ["PASS"],
    "WEST": ["ALL_TRUMP"],
    "NORTH": ["PASS"],
    "EAST": ["PASS"]
  },
  "combination_claims": {
    "SOUTH": [],
    "WEST": [],
    "NORTH": [],
    "EAST": []
  },
  "trick": {
    "WEST": null,
    "NORTH": "♦K",
    "EAST": "♦9"
  },
  "hand": [
    "♧Q", "♧A"
  ],
  "trick_initiator": "EAST",
  "trick_asking_suit": "Clubs",
  "trick_winning_card": "♧J",
  "possible_actions": [
    "♤9", "♤10", "♤A"
  ]
}
```
You can deduce the following:
The EAST opponent will win the trick because he played the strongest available card of the Clubs suit - the ♧J.
You are playing on ALL_TRUMPS this round, so there is no way for a card from another suit other than Clubs to win the trick.

You should play the first option, with index 0,
because that will give fewer points to the opponents.
Additionally, that will make your other card you hold - the ♧A - the dominant card,
 meaning it will be the strongest available card of the Clubs suit next trick.
`[Option 0] Action: ♤9`



Example Eg3:
Given the state of the game:
```json
{
  "bids": {
    "SOUTH": ["PASS"],
    "WEST": ["DIAMONDS"],
    "NORTH": ["PASS"],
    "EAST": ["PASS"]
  },
  "combination_claims": {
    "SOUTH": [],
    "WEST": [],
    "NORTH": [],
    "EAST": []
  },
  "previous_tricks": [
    {
      "WEST": "♥J",
      "NORTH": "♥10",
      "EAST": "♥Q",
      "SOUTH": "♥A"
    },
    {
      "WEST": "♤9",
      "NORTH": "♤A",
      "EAST": "♤J",
      "SOUTH": "♤7"
    },
    {
      "WEST": "♧J",
      "NORTH": "♤8",
      "EAST": "♦10",
      "SOUTH": "♤10"
    },
    {
      "WEST": "♥9",
      "NORTH": "♦K",
      "EAST": "♦7",
      "SOUTH": "♦Q"
    }
  ],
  "trick": {
    "WEST": null,
    "NORTH": "♧K",
    "EAST": "♧10"
  },
  "hand": [
    "♦9", "♦A", "♦J", "♠K"
  ],
  "trick_initiator": "NORTH",
  "trick_asking_suit": "Clubs",
  "trick_winning_card": "♧10",
  "possible_actions": [
    "♦9", "♦A", "♦J"
  ]
}
```
You can deduce the following:
Seven of the eight Diamonds Trump cards are accounted for.
 You are holding three of them: ♦9, ♦J, ♦A.
 Four have been played in previous tricks already: ♦10, ♦7, ♦Q, ♦K
There is one Diamonds Trump card that is either in NORTH or in EAST: ♦8

The ♤K is dominant in the Spades because the stronger Spades have already been played in previous tricks: ♤A, ♤10
If you play the ♤K, then EAST will play a Diamonds Trump card, if they have any,
 because they previously played Trump over Spades, indicating they do not have Spades.

You have to play a Diamonds card because you do not have a Clubs card, and your teammate is not winning the trick, and you do have a Trump suit.

You should pick the first option, with index 0, because all the Trumps you are holding are dominant, and the first one uses up the fewest point and leaves the stronger ones still available for play.
`[Option 0] Action: ♦9`
